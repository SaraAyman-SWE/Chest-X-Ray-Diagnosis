# Chest-X-ray-Diagnosis

Given the chest X-ray dataset, our goal is to build a range of neural networks to diagnose chest
X-rays. Our database consists of patients suffering from COVID-19, Pneumonia, and normal
Patients (3 classes).

# 1. Data Exploration

  a. Download data using URL link
  
  b. Investigate the shape of images. 
  
  c. Investigate different data augmentation methods. 
  
  d. Split data training, validation, and testing. 
  
  
# 2. Basic Models

  a. Building a fully connected neural network. You should try 2 different architectures (many
  layers vs few)
  
  b. Building a convolutional neural network with a classification layer at the end (many layers vs few).
  
  
# 3. Improved Models

  a. use famous backbones.
  
  - ResNet 18-50
  - DenseNet 
  
  b. Repeat the above step Using pre-trained weight
